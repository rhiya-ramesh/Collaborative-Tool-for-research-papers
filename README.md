research papers/thesis in groups and get it reviewed from their guide or professor. For each
document you can have multiple 'contributors' but only one 'reviewer'.

Contributors can:
1) Create content/documents.
2) Comment on the content.
3) Accept/Reject comments. Reply to comments.
4) Edit document and save new versions of it.
5) Can view the content being edited simultaneously.

Reviewers can :
1) Comment on the content.

The application displays all versions of the documents with and without
comments
